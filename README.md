Student Builds "Creppy-Uppy" with GPT as AI Co-Pilot

Innovative approach to creating a game called "Creppy-Uppy". I leveraged the power
of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) as an AI co-pilot throughout the
development process.
GPT as a Guide, not a Code Master
While GPT initially provided inaccurate information on game mechanics, I
effectively fine-tuned its responses by giving clearer instructions. This highlights
GPT's potential as a helpful tool for brainstorming and refining game concepts, rather
than a source of perfect code.
Overcoming Programming Hurdles
The project wasn't without its challenges. I encountered bugs like unintended game
termination on missed bounces and inaccurate scoring. I tackled these issues head-on,
demonstrating a strong understanding of core programming concepts. They
implemented solutions to:
• Prevent the game from quitting prematurely.
• Fix the bounce counting logic for a more accurate scoring system.
• Animate the player character using multiple image frames.
• Integrate background music using Pygame's mixer module.
These solutions showcase the ability to troubleshoot and apply their programming
knowledge.
Beyond the Basics: Creative Flair
The creativity extended beyond core gameplay mechanics. I incorporated a custom
background and even added their own piano music, demonstrating a well-rounded
approach to game development.
Learning Through Collaboration
This project exemplifies how AI tools like GPT can empower to learn and create. By
working alongside GPT, I gained valuable experience in:
• Game design principles
• Programming fundamentals
• Problem-solving and debugging techniques
Overall, this text showcases a successful collaboration between a human and GPT,
resulting in the creation of a unique and functional game.
